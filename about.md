I care about **machine learning**, **agentic AI**, and **health systems performance**.

**Skills**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), R (tidyverse), SQL, Java (DSA)
- ML/AI: regression/classification, trees/ensembles, basic NLP/CV, LLM tooling
- Tools: Git/GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, VS Code, Linux, Docker (basics)
- Data: EDA, cleaning, viz, hypothesis testing

**Education**
- Rutgers University — B.S. Data Science (Minor: Health Administration), *Dec 2026*
  - Coursework: Regression Methods, Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms

**Experience**
